Here are the key reasons why we are strongly recommending the addition of a new value—"Old Code"—under the "Nature of Work" field:

1. Inapplicability of "Working Feature Broken":
When we try to use the "Working feature broken" option, we’re unable to answer a critical question: Which version was it actually working in?
Since we’re dealing with security vulnerabilities in legacy code, there often isn't a known version where it was confirmed to be working as expected. This makes the option unsuitable for AppSec-related issues.


2. Incorrect Priority Assignment:
Selecting "Working feature broken" automatically changes the ticket priority to P2, which is not ideal for AppSec Jira tickets.
Our process sets the default priority to P3, and for higher-risk items, we rely on the Severity field to indicate Critical or High vulnerabilities. The current setup disrupts this prioritization logic.


3. Impact on Other Teams' Tracking:
We are also unsure whether other teams, apart from QA, are using this field for their own tracking and reporting purposes.
Introducing AppSec usage into an existing category may unintentionally affect dashboards, filters, or reports maintained by other functions.

To avoid this confusion and maintain process clarity for all stakeholders, we believe adding a dedicated option like "Old Code" is the most logical and least disruptive approach.

It will help us accurately tag legacy vulnerabilities, preserve data integrity across teams, and avoid interfering with existing workflows.
